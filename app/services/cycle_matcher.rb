# CycleMatcher
#
# Identifies a collection of due_ons as a specific Cycle.
#
# During the import of the legacy acc_info file the import_charge code presents
# ChargeRow with a number of reoccurring dates (day and month that occur every
# year) - these dates are converted into an id that matches a charge cycle. This
# is the class responsible for the conversion.
