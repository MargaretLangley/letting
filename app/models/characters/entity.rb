# Entity
#
# Why does this class exist?
#
# represents a person (individual or a company) in the application.
#
# How does this fit into the larger system
#
# Entity are used in Properties, clients, and agent / agents.
# The name and addresses were paired together in the contactable module
# in all the above cases.
#
#
# The polymorphic relationship, entitieable, allowing a model to associate
# with more than one other model type (client, Property and Agent).
#
# The module was introduced for code reuse (having a has_a contact would
# have been worth investigating).
