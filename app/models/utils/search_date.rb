# SearchDate
#
# Validates a date and converts it into a datetime covering
# that date. Used for Payment search which requires you to
# search a day.
#
# Matching a DateTime is awkward - either you round it to the nearest date
# (can be a problem as it's impossible to reverse the process) or you form
# a range. This is the range solution.
