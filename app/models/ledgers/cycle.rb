# Cycle
#
# Represents the repeated dates a charge becomes due in the year
#
# Charges have one of a few number of patterns of repeated due_dates.
# A cycle has a name identifier and a number of the repeated dates.
# A charge belongs to a Cycle and a Cycle has many charges.
#
# Cycle has many due_ons (the dates when a charge happens, becomes due)
