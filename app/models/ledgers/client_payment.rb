# ClientPayment
#
# Returns the payments made to a client for house ground rent.
#
# Clients have a number of properties that ground rent are charged on.
# When a tenant pays money for this charge the client gets this money
# minus handling fees.
#
# Houses are either divided into Mar/Sep and Jun/Dec. So, for each house
# payments are broken into 6 month periods starting either Mar and Sep or
# Jun and Dec - periods are always started on the 1st day of the month.
#
#
# Client Payment uses an Ajax Request
#
# Got Ajax request by using: GoRails
# https://gorails.com/episodes/jquery-ujs-and-ajax
#
# 1) Create an additional route which Ajax can query the back-end with.
#
# resources :clients do
#   member do
#     patch :payment
#   end
# end
#
#
# 2) Add a link to the additional patched route
#
# _account_heading.erb
#
# client_payment_path(client_id, year: year, month: month)
# link_to 'my ajax', payment_client_path(client_id, year: year, month: month)
#                  , method: :patch
#                  , remote: true
#
# This create a link: data-method="patch" and href="/clients/5/payment?.."
#
#
# 3) This is applied an action on the clients_controller
#
# class ClientsController < ApplicationController
#   def payment
#     @client_payment  = ( new assignment to be redisplayed )
#   end
#
#
# 4) The link_to is a remote Ajax call which is satisfied by: payment.js.erb
#
# views/clients/payment.js.erb
#
# $('.js-payment-details').html("<%= escape_javascript(render partial:
#   "client_payments/client_payment",
#   locals: { client_payment: @client_payment }) %>");
#
#
# 5) Add link which the Ajax will add content to:
#    <div class='js-payment-details'>
#      content written here
#    </div>
#
# rubocop: disable  Metrics/LineLength
