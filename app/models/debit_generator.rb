# DebitGenerator
#
# Why does the class exist?
#
# To search a group of properties for charges that are due and generate
# the debits.
#
# How does it fit into the larger system?
#
# Coverts due charges into debits. The debits are then used for invoicing
# owing debits and later credits through payments.
