# Permission
#
# Authorization of a user accessing the application.
#
# How does it fit in to the larger system
#
# All controllers and some views check to see if the current user has
# permissions to continue with the request.
#
# guest users - not logged in
# users       - standard users - access to everything except admin controllers
#                                this is the users controller
# admin users - admin          - access to users controller - allowed to create
#                                and edit users but otherwise the same as a
#                                user
