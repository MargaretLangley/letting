# Invoice Requires
#
# Invoice contains the dynamic data needed to make an invoice.
# Invoice works with the static date (invoice_text) to create a viewable and
# printable invoice.
#
# Invoices are created during a run by the invoices_maker.
#
# An Invoice is made of:
#
# property
#  - property_ref (human_ref)
#  - occupiers (name of tenant)
#  - property_address (building's address)
#  - billing_address (agent or building's address)
#  - client_address
#
# snapshot
#   - Product (Invoice line item)
#      - charge_type
#      - date_due
#      - automatic_payment
#      - amount
#      - period (period_first..period_last) - period the charge covers.
#
# invoice_date - date the invoice is made on.
# comments - one off information to be read by the bill's addressee.
#
