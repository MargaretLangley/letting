# PaymentDecorator
#
# Adds behaviour to the payment object
#
# Used when the payment has need for behaviour outside of the core
# of the model. Specifically for display information.
#
# The main issue is with credit signs. The accounts system maintains negative
# credits. However, the users don't want to think about signs - they want to
# enter data. The decorator changes the sign when displaying data and we change
# it back before saving it.
#
# Sign changing methods
# credits_decorated  - negative to positive.
# initializer        - positive to negative.
