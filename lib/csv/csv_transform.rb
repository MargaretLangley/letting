  # CSVTransform
  #
  # Opens a CSV file and reads it into an array of arrays.
  #
  # How does this fit into the larger system?
  #
  # This is the first part of the importing system. The data is available to
  # this system through a number of CSV files. This class if responsible for
  # opening the CSV files and returning the information as an array of arrays.
  # The allows the rest of the system to be unaware of the format of the data.
  #
  # The importing system receives arrays which are indexed by
  # symbols matching the attributes of the models - allowing mass assignment
  # where appropriate.
  #
  # The symbols are set in the headers initializer
  #
  # In short the remaining import system has a class for each model and uses
  # the shared import_base for much of the work.
  # The arrays are read into the import_base where the actual importation
  # occurs.
