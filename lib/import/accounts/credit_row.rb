  # CreditRow
  #
  # Wraps around an imported row of data acc_items.
  #
  # Called during the Importing of accounts information.
  # Credit rows are selected and passed to ImportCredit by the
  # ImportAccount object.
  # During the importing the row is wrapped with this CreditRow. Credit object
  # needs to relate to other database objects, charges in this case, and some
  # data fields needs to be converted into different types;
  # this class is responsible for data conversion of the csv field and leaves
  # ImportCredit to create/assign database objects (Credits) and their related
  # fields.
